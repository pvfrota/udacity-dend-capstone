# Data Engineering Capstone Project

## Project Summary

The objective of this project is to develop a database for recommendation and analytics based on data from product reviews on the Amazon.com website, in addition to the Amazon.com product metadata.

The views intended for recommendation can be placed on an index and serve as a recommendation system for when a user accesses a particular product.

The views destined for analytics, on the other hand, may show products that are being poorly reviewed and/or under-sold, and come to help in decision making.

## Project Structure

The project workspace includes:
- `helpers`: module with functions to help to run the pipeline
- `images`: folder with images necessary to the documentation of the project
- `output`: output to save '.parquet' files
- `sample_data`: folder with data necessary to run the pipeline
- `sql_queries`: module with all SQL queries necessary to run and test the pipeline
- `Capstone Project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the project description, in addition to the functions needed to run it
